【答案与解析】

1. 选B。It’s time you did 为 It’s time you thanked Aunt Lucy for her present 之略。按照英语语法，it’s time 后从句通常要用过去式。

2. 选A。虽然前有虚拟条件句, 后有使用了虚拟语气的宾语，但 I don’t know 却宜用一般现在时，因为 I don’t know 表述的是现在的真实情况，句意为“我要不是有幸遇到你，我真不知(指现在不知)我会做出什么蠢事来”。

3. 选B。I’d rather 后接从句时，从句谓语的时态规律是：用过去式表示现在或将来，用过去完成式表示过去。

4. 选A。we can’t get there by tomorrow 为客观事实，故宜用陈述语气。

5. 选B。第一空填 knew，因为 I wish 后的宾语从句要用虚拟语气(即用过去式表示现在的想法);第二空要填lives，即用陈述语气，因为 where he lives 是一个客观事实，而不是 I wish 的内容。

6. 选C。It’s time… / It’s high time… / It’s about time… 等后接从句时，从句谓语通常用过去式。

7. 选 B。此题涉及错综时间虚拟条件句，主句与现在事实相反，条件句与过去事实相反。句意为：要不是在七岁时就迷上了 Melinda Cox 图书馆，我真不能想像我如今会在做什么。

8. 选 D。这是otherwise 引出的含蓄虚拟语气，再根据前面的 hesitated 可进一步知道这是与过去事实相反的虚拟语气，由此可推知答案选 D。

9. 选 C。if only 意为“要是……就好了”，其后的句子谓语要用虚拟语气，同时根据 as the doctor instructed 中的过去时态可知从句是与过去事实相反，故选 C。

10. 选 A。without 引出的介词短语为一个与现在事实相反的含蓄条件句。

11. 选 D。otherwise 在此相当于 if she had not walked away from the discussion，即暗示一个与过去事实相反的虚拟条件句。

12. 选 D。根据句中的 didn’t let me drive 可知，这是一个与过去事实相反的虚拟语气句，条件句的谓语用 had+过去分词，主句谓语用 would / should / could / might have+过去分词。

13. 选 C。as if 引导的句子，有时用虚拟语气，有时不用。原则上说，若指事实或可能为事实，不用虚拟语气;若指现在，从句谓语动词用一般过去时(be 用 were);若指过去用过去完成时，若指将来用过去将来时或用 were to do sth。又如下面一题要选 C：

It seems as if the sun ____ round the earth since it rises in the east and sets in the west.

A. circles B. is circling

C. were circling D. has been circling

14. 选C。but for 的意思是“若不是，要不是”，用于引出与事实相反的假设，通常与虚拟语气连用。根据句中的 the help you gave me，可知它表示与过去事实相反，故选C。
