    怎样划分英语句子中的成分？ 
    主语，谓语，表语，宾语，宾语补足语，定语，状语分别有什么用 
    其次，要系统学习名词、代词、数词、形容词、动词、副词等此类，了解什么词可以充当句中的什么要素。一般的，名词做主语和宾语，动词作谓语，形容词修饰名词和做表语，副词修饰句子或者动词…… 定语、状语 
    句子，汉语中常用?……的?表示。定语通常位于被修饰的成分前。若修饰some,any,every,no构成的复合不定代词时，（如：something、nothing）；或不定式、分词短语作定语、从句作定语时，则定语通常置后。副词用作定语时须放在名词之后。 形容词作定语： 
    the little boy needs a blue pen.(little修饰名词boy；blue修饰名词pen.）/小男孩需要一支兰色的钢笔。 
    tom is a handsome boy./tom是个英俊的男孩。 there is a good boy./有个乖男孩。 数词作定语相当于形容词： 
    two boys need two pens./两个男孩需要两支钢笔。 the two boys are students./这两个男孩是学生。 
    there are two boys in the room./房间里有两个男孩。  代词或名词所有格作定语： 
    his boy needs tom\s pen./他的男孩需要tom的钢笔。 his name is tom./他的名字是汤姆。 there are two boys of toms there. /那儿有tom家的两个男孩。  介词短语作定语： 
    the boy in the classroom needs a pen of yours./ 教室里的男孩需要你的一支钢笔。 
    the boy in blue is tom./穿兰色衣服的孩子是汤姆。 there are two boys of 9,and three of 10./ 有两个9岁的，三个10岁的男孩。 名词作定语： 
    the boy needs a ball pen./男孩需要一支圆珠笔。 it is a ball pen./这是一支圆珠笔。
    there is only one ball pen in the pencil box./这铅笔盒里只有一支圆珠笔。 
    副词作定语： 
    the boy there needs a pen./那儿的男孩需要一支钢笔。 the best boy here is tom./这里最棒的男孩是tom。 不定式作定语： 
    the boy to write this letter needs a pen. /写这封信的男孩需要一支钢笔。 
    the boy to write this letter is tom./将要写这封信的男孩是汤姆。 there is nothing to do today./今天无事要做。  分词（短语）作定语： 
    the smiling boy needs a pen bought by his mother./那个微笑的男孩需要一支他妈妈买的钢笔。 
    the pen bought by her is made in china./她买的笔是中国产的。 there are five boys left./有五个留下的男孩。 定语从句： 
    the boy who is reading needs the pen which you bought yesterday./那个在阅读的男孩需要你昨天买的钢笔。 
    the boy you will know is tom./你将认识的男孩叫汤姆。 
    there are five boys who will play the game./参加游戏的男孩有五个。
    状语修饰动词、形容词、副词或全句，说明方式、因果、条件、时间、地点、让步、方向、程度、目的等。 
    状语在句子中的位置很灵活，常见情况为：通常在句子基本结构之后，强调时放在句首；修饰形容词或副词时，通常位于被修饰的词之前；表示时间、地点、目的的状语一般位于句子两头，强调时放在句首，地点状语一般须在时间状语之前；一些表示不确定时间（如：often）或程度（如：almost）的副词状语通常位于be动词、助动词、情态动词之后，动词之前。 有时状语在句中的某个位置会引起歧义，应注意，如：the boy calls the girl in the classroom.一般理解成?男孩喊教室里的女孩?（此时in the classroom为girl的定语），也可以理解为?男孩在教室里喊女孩?（此时in the classroom为地点状语），最好写作?in the classroom,the boy calls the girl.\ 
    副词（短语）作状语： 
    the boy needs a pen very much./男孩非常需要一支钢笔。（程度状语） 
    the boy needs very much the pen bought by his mother./男孩非常需  
    要他母亲买的那支钢笔。（宾语较长则状语前置） the boy really needs a pen./男孩真的需要一支钢笔。（程度状语） the boy needs a pen now./now,the boy needs a pen./the boy,now,needs a pen./男孩现在需要一支钢笔。（时间状语） 
    介词短语作状语：in the classroom,the boy needs a pen./在教室里，男孩需要一支钢笔。（地点状语） before his mother,tom is always a boy./ 
    在母亲面前,汤姆总是一个男孩子.(条件状语) on sundays,there is no student in the classroom./ 星期天,教室里没有学生.(时间状语)  分词（短语）作状语： 
    he sits there,asking for a pen./ 他坐在那儿要一支笔。（表示伴随状态） 
    having to finish his homework,the boy needs a pen. /因为不得不完成作业，男孩需要一支笔。（原因状语） frightened,he sits there soundlessly./ 
    （因为）受了惊吓，他无声地坐在那儿。（原因状语）  不定式作状语： 
    the boy needs a pen to do his homework./男孩需要一支笔写家庭作业。（目的状语） 
    时间状语从句、地点状语从句、原因状语从句、结果状语从句、目的状语从句 
    、比较状语从句、让步状语从句、条件状语从句 
    同位语是在名词或代词之后并列名词或代词对前者加以说明的成分，近乎于后置定语。如： 
    we students should study hard. / (students是we的同位语，都是指同一批?学生?） 
    we all are students. / (all是we的同位语，都指同样的?我们
    ?） 
    为句子独立成分(注意：区别于分词独立结构)。 感叹词：oh,hello,aha,ah,等。 肯定词yes 
    2 
    否定词no 
    称呼语：称呼人的用语。 
    插入语：一些句中插入的 i think , i believe,等。 
    情态词,表示说话人的语气（多作为修饰全句的状语）:perhaps也许,maybe大概,acturely实际上,certainly当然，等。 
    分词独立结构：分词作状语时其逻辑主语与句子的主语一致! 否则应有自己的逻辑主语，构成分词独立结构。 例： 
    错句：studying hard,your score will go up. 
    正确：(1) studying hard,you can make your score go up. 或 (2)if you study hard,your score will go up. 
    解析：错句中分词studying没有自带逻辑主语，则其逻辑主语就是句子的主语，既your score . 显然做study的应是人，不应是your score（分数）. 正确句(1)更正了句子的主语,使其与分词逻辑主语一致( 同为you );正确句(2)则使用条件分句带出study的主语,(不过已经不是分词结构了). 分词独立结构常省略being,having been.不过?there being...?的场合不能省略. 如： 
    game (being) over,he went home. 
    he stands there,book (being) in hand. 独立结构还可用with、without引导，作状语或定语。这种结构不但可以用分词，还可以用不定式、形容词、介词短语、副词或名词等。 如： 
    with nothing to do,he fell asleep soon./无事可做，他很快就睡着了。 the teacher came in,with glasses on his nose./老师进来了，戴着一付眼镜。（注意，此句on his nose不可省略！）

    英语划分句子成分 
    （一）句子成分的定义：构成句子的各个部分叫做句子成分。句子成分有主要成分和次要成分；主要成分有主语和谓语；次要成分有表语、宾语、定语、状语、补足语和同位语。 
    （二）主语：主语是一个句子所叙述的主体，一般位于句首。但在there be结构、疑问句（当主语不疑问词时）和倒装句中，主语位于谓语、助动词或情态动词后面。主语可由名词、代词、数词、不定式、动名词、名词化的形容词和主语从句等表示。例如： 
    when we are going to have an english test has not been decided.（主语从句） 
    it is necessary to master a foreign language.（it作形式主语，真正的主语为后面的不定式） 
    （三）谓语：谓语说明主语所做的动作或具有的特征和状态。动词在句中作谓语，一般放在主语之后。谓语的构成如下： 
    1、简单谓语：由一个动词或动词短语构成。如：he practices running every morning. 
    2、复合谓语：（1）由情态动词或其他助动词加动词原形构成。如：you may keep the book for two weeks. he has caught a bad cold. （2）由系动词加表语构成。如：we are students. 
    （五）宾语：宾语表示动作的对象或承爱者，一般位于及物动词和介词后面。例如：  they went to see an exhibition（展览）yesterday.（名词） 
    how many dictionaries do you have? i have five.（数词） 
    they helped the old with their housework yesterday. he pretended not to see me.（不定式短语）  i enjoy listening to popular music.动名词短语）i think（that）he is fit for his office.（宾语从句） 宾语种类：（1）双宾语（间接宾语+直接宾语），要求双宾语(直接宾语和间接宾语)的动词，直接宾语提前，动词后加to或for，现归纳如下。①后面加to的动词：give 给tell 告诉bring 带来send 寄，送hand 交给read 读pass 递给return 把……还给……lend 借给throw 扔……给……leave 留给promise 许诺，答应refuse 拒绝 
    ②后面加for的动词：get 得到make 制造，做buy 买do 做play 演奏order 命令
    sing 唱歌pay 为……而付钱 
    （2）复合宾语（宾语+宾补），例如：they elected him their monitor. 
    （六）宾语补足语：英语中有些及物动词，除有一个直接宾语以外，还要有一个宾语补语，才能使句子的意义完整。带有宾语补足语的一般句型为：某些及物动词+宾语+宾补。※宾语+名词”常用于改结构的动词有：call, name, make, find, choose, think, leave※宾语+形容词”常见的动词有think, believe, leave, drive, make, keep, turn, wish, want▲“宾语+副词”。 ▲“宾语+介词短语”。 ▲“宾语+不定式”。充当宾补的不定式有三种： a 要求带to的不定式b 要求不带to 的不定式 let, make, have，see, , watch, , look at, hear, listen to, feel等，用不定式作宾语补语时，要省去“to”。但用于被动语态时，还要 加上“to等 c 单词help 后可加 to 或不加 to▲“宾语+现在分词” see, , watch, , look at, hear, listen to, feel▲“宾语+过去分词” ▲ 形式宾语＋形容词▲宾语+what 从句  +※主补：对主语的补充。 
    例如：his father named him dongming.（名词）they painted their boat white.（形容词） let the fresh air in.（副词）you mustn’t force him to lend his money to you.（不定式短语） we saw her entering the room.（现在分词）we found everything in the lab in good order.（介词短语）we will soon make our city what your city is now.（从句） 
    （七）定语：修饰名词或代词的词、短语或从句称为定语。定语可由以下等成分表示：  guilin is a beautiful city.（形容词） 
    china is a developing country; america is a developed country.（分词） 
    there are thirty women teachers is our school.（名词） 
    his rapid progress in english made us surprised.（代词）

    the teaching plan for next term has been worked out.（动名词） 
    he is reading an article about how to learn english.（介词短语） 
    （八）状语：修饰动词、形容词、副词或整个句子，说明动作或状态特征的句子成分，叫做状语。可由以下形式表示： light travels most quickly.（副词及副词性词组） 
    he has lived in the city for ten years.（介词短语）
